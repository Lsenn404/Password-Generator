Password generator. Prompts user to enter how long they want their password, between 8 - 128 characters, then asks if they want it to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. Will confirm that the user has selected at least one of the four character types, then generates a password. Will check if the password contains at least one character from each type that the user has selected, and if not, will generate a new password before displaying it for the user.
